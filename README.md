# Exploring Urban Mobility: Insights from Uber Pickups in NYC

## Description
In this R project, I analyzed the Uber Pickups dataset from New York City. The project focused on leveraging the ggplot2 library for comprehensive data visualization and analysis. The primary objective was to gain insights into Uber customers' travel behaviors and preferences based on the dataset's exploration. Through visualizations and exploratory analysis, the project aimed to uncover patterns and trends in Uber service usage, including peak travel times, popular pickup locations, and demographic insights. These findings contribute to a better understanding of urban mobility dynamics and support strategic decision-making for service optimization and customer satisfaction in urban transportation.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project comprises Uber pickup records spanning from April 2014 to September 2014 in New York City. It includes detailed information such as timestamps of each trip, geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of pickup locations, bases where trips originated, and possibly additional variables like trip duration or customer demographics (if available).
