# Exploring Urban Mobility: Insights from Uber Pickups in NYC

## Description
Understanding customer behaviors and preferences is crucial for optimizing urban mobility services. This project analyzes the Uber Pickups dataset from New York City, using the ggplot2 library for data visualization and analysis. Its primary objective is to uncover insights into Uber customers' travel patterns and behaviors, facilitating strategic decision-making to enhance service and customer satisfaction.

The analysis begins with exploratory data analysis, focusing on key metrics such as peak travel times, popular pickup locations across boroughs, and demographic insights of Uber customers. This exploration provides a comprehensive overview of urban mobility dynamics, revealing trends that influence service demand and operational efficiency.

Using a dataset enriched with spatial and temporal variables, the analysis employs geospatial mapping and interactive visualizations to highlight Uber pickup hotspots and travel density. By segmenting the data and analyzing trends over time, the project identifies patterns in user behavior and service utilization, offering actionable insights for optimizing resource allocation and improving service delivery.

This project enhances understanding of urban transportation dynamics and supports strategic decisions aimed at improving service quality and customer experience. The findings and recommendations can inform future urban mobility strategies, fostering efficiency and satisfaction among Uber customers in New York City.
